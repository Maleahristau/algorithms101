# Assignment Two:
### Show your understanding of Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm.

The Fisher-Yates Shuffle is a random permutation of a finite sequence. The idea is that out of a list of numbers you select a 
random number crossing it off the list until you have all of those former numbers all listed once in a new random order. The 
idea was to arange these numbers so the list wasn't bias at all.
